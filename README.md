# ReadStack üìö

ReadStack is a full-stack web application designed for avid readers to track their reading journey. It allows users to create a personal library of books, complete with cover art and AI-generated summaries, ensuring you never forget the key details of what you've read.

## \#\# About The Project

Forgetting the plot twists, main characters, or the core message of a book you read months ago is a common problem for readers. ReadStack solves this by providing a simple and elegant platform to log your books. By just entering a book's title and author, the application generates a beautiful card containing the book's cover and a unique summary crafted by Google's Gemini AI. This allows you to quickly recall the essence of any book in your collection.

## \#\# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Database Hosting

This project is currently deployed using a free-tier PostgreSQL instance which has a limited trial period (approximately 3 months).

If the live site is inaccessible, it is likely because the database service has expired. I will manually migrate the data and redeploy the application to a new instance as soon as I am aware of the issue. **All user data will be preserved** during this process. Your patience is appreciated\!
